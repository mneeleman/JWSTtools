Basic Table of Contents for NIRCam PCE (throughput) tarball:

Top Level Directories:

DBS - contains DBS throughput curve files and plot
OTE - contains OET throughput curve and plot
QE - contains QE coefficients and QE plot
optics - contains optics throughput curves and plot
modA - Module A throughput curves
modB - Module B throughput curves
modAB_mean - module-averaged throughput curves


Within each directory:

DBS:
Contains the 4 files with tabulated DBS values.
DBS_LW_ModA_highres.txt	
DBS_LW_ModB_highres.txt	
DBS_SW_ModA__highres_1_minus_trans_plus_absorb.txt
DBS_SW_ModB_highres.txt	

The SW Mod A file contains the corrected DBS curve which we calculated
using 1 - (transmission+absorption).

DBS_ModA_curves.pdf - plot of DBS mod A curves
DBS_ModA_curves.pdf - plot of DBS mod B curves
new_DBS_SWA_highres_1_minus_trans_plus_absorb_zoom* - plots of updated SWA curve.
plot_dbs.py - script to produce DBS plots


OTE:
jwst_telescope_ote_thruput.txt - tabulated OTE throughput curve
OTE_throughput_plot.pdf	- plot of OTE throughput
plot_ote.py - script used to produce plot


QE: 
QE_curves.pdf - plot of QE curves
plot_qe.py - script used to produce plot. Script includes the polynomial
             coefficients used to described the curves.


optics:
NIRCam_optics_transmission_29Oct2015.csv - tabulated throughput values for the
                                           various optics components
Optics_components_plot.pdf - plot of optics components		
nircam_optics_filter_average.dat - filter-averaged optics values. Used primarily
for the scatter term.	
plot_optics.py - script used to produce plot

       plots of PCE curves. One file for each filter:
       <filter>_nrc_and_ote_throughput_moda.png

       plots showing the contribution of each component to the total PCE. One
       plot for each filter, named:
       Step_by_step_plot_<filter>_modA.pdf

       Table showing the contribution of each component to the PCE at a central
       wavelength. One file for each filter, named:
       Ste_by_step_table_<filter>_modA.txt

       Table listing the properties of each filter. Bandwidth, effective response,
       half-power points, etc.
